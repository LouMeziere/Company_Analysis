# Employee Analysis Project


## Description: Analyzing Workforce Data Using SQL Queries

The goal of this project is to analyze and gain insights into the company's workforce by examining employee data. We will use SQL queries to investigate gender distribution over time, employee activity in departments, average salaries by department and gender, and salary ranges. By leveraging this data, we aim to understand workforce dynamics, identify trends, and uncover patterns that can inform HR decisions and strategic planning. The ultimate objective is to improve organizational understanding and make data-driven decisions regarding employee management and compensation.
